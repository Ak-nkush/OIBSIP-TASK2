# OIBSIP-TASK2
This is the task 2 of the internship provided by the oasis infotech in the web development. The task was to create a tribute page using html and css . I decided to take the tribute page on the stanley lee well known 
as the creator of our childhood superheros like spiderman, ironman, wolverine , etc. It test the individuals knowledge in the css and the fundamentnals of the html. The challenging thing to do how much relevant 
information to give about a person on the tribute page, lot of textual information doesn't engage the viewer, soo I had added some little amount of textual information and highlighted the main and significant points 
of this lifetime.
